                            <p>I was born January 1994 in Cleveland, Ohio. I attended Lutheran High School West where I ran
                                cross country and participated in building sets for the drama department. In 2016, I graduated
                                from Butler University with a bachelorâ€™s degree in actuarial science. Currently, I work part-time
                                at Kohls as a freight associate.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>During my time at college, I learned that actuarial science was not something I was interested
                                in pursuing. Since then, I have continued my education, while simultaneously looking for
                                full-time employment. Currently, I am working on developing my web development and programing
                                knowledge in hopes to work in data analysis.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>In my free time, I enjoy jogging, watching movies and tv shows, and playing video games with
                                my friends.</p>
